This folder contains the 6th part of the course, i.e. the assembler<br>
The Python file named assembler1 is used to create the hack file from an asm file.<br>
the file required_functions contains the translate function and function for removing symbols<br>
other hack files here are the files which are formed when I converted using the assembler<br>
these files are Max, Add, Rect, and Pong. The assembly files are available in the 06 folder which you downloaded from the course website
