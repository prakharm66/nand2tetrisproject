Created a computer which could run the given assembly codes(after they are compiled by the inbuilt compiler)<br>
Used 2 registers, program counter, ALU and some logic gates and multiplexers/demultiplexers to create the CPU which takes a 16 bit instruction and a 16 bit value as input and gives a 16 but output<br>
Since there are separate lines for program memory and instruction memory (RAM and ROM), this is Harvard Architecture<br>
Used the CPU, 16k RAM chip, and an 32K bit inbuilt ROM chip (this would save the assembled code as sequence of instructions) to create a computer
